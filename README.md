Tool to edit meshes so that they can be modded into Kena: Bridge of Spirts without crashing



How To Use:

Run the exe and select the .uasset of your mesh when prompted(making sure your .uexp is in the same directory), it will then create a NEW.uasset and a NEW.uexp, replace the originals with the new one and pack like normal
