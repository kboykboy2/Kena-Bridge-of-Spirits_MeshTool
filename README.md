# Kena-Bridge-of-Spirits_MeshTool
a Tool that edits meshes so that they can be modded into Kena: Bridge of Spirts without crashing, the tool was made very quickly and sometimes may fail, especially on high poly models.



# How To Use:

Cook your mesh in ue4 like normal(the game uses ue4.25) Run the exe and select the .uasset of your mesh when prompted(making sure your .uexp is in the same directory), it will then create a NEW.uasset and a NEW.uexp, replace the originals with the new ones and pack like normal

you may need to use this build of umodel to extract models from Kena: Bridge of Spirts https://www.gildor.org/smf/index.php/topic,7922.0.html
